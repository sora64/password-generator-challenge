Password Generator

In this challenge I have created a password generator that allows users to create a password anywhere from 8 to 128 characters in length, using randomized confirmations of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals, and special characters. Users may pick and choose between these character types using window confirm prompts, which are recorded and funneled into the randomizer. The randomizer then pushes its output to an empty array, which becomes the final randomized password requested by the user.

In this challenge I used if statements, a for loop for the randomizer, and had to learn how to join randomized values from different arrays and then push those values to an empty array (thank you to Google). I also had to name variables and assign them either locally to a function or globally, depending on how pervasive I wanted them to be.
